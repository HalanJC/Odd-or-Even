# Odd-or-Even
The hand cricket game we played in middle school but digitized

How To Play
Out : When both players throw the same number, the player who's batting gets outed
Batting : The player who is batting gets the run he throws and tries to evade being outed
Batting : The player who is balling tries to out the player who is batting
Run : The number that the player batting has thrown
total runs: The sum of all runs taken till player got out

You're playing against the computer where both get a chance at batting and balling alternatively.
Whoever takes more runs, wins.
